I am a data analyst with experience in marketing and ecology. I currently work at [Kantar](https://www.kantar.com/) where I do software development with R, before that I worked in CONABIO (Mexicoâ€™s National Commission of Biodiversity) doing statistical analysis related to biodiversity. My interests include Statistical modeling (hierarchical models, spatial statistics, Bayesian networks), Survey design and Survey data analysis, Machine learning, and Data visualization. 

I enjoy teaching, I teach statistic courses to master students in Data Science and to bachelors in Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences at [ITAM](https://cienciadedatos.itam.mx/es/71/contenido/plan-de-estudios-de-la-licenciatura-en-ciencia-de-datos-del-itam). I collaborate with the Mexican *Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers* [CDSB](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/) teaching R workshops. And often deliver custom R training (introduction to R, survey data analysis in R, maps with R,...), I have trained people with diverse backgrounds: [RMB](https://www.redmexicanadebioinformatica.org/navegando-y-explotando-el-poder-del-tidyverse/), [CONABIO](https://www.gob.mx/conabio), [SAI](http://www.sai.com.mx), [OXFAM Mexico](https://www.oxfammexico.org), [GNP](https://www.gnp.com.mx), [SAT](https://www.sat.gob.mx/home) and [COLMEX](https://www.colmex.mx).

Lastly, I :heart R, I am co-organizer of [R-Ladies CDMX](http://meetup.com/rladiescdmx/) and I regularly give talks related to R.
