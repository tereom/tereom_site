summary = "We adapted the semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics found in [Flaxman et al. (2020)](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/handle/10044/1/77731) to produce state-level estimates of the number of infections and the time-varying reproduction number (the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual) as a function of human mobility. [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09117.pdf) we explain the model in detail and the assumptions made for Mexico and [here](https://covid19mex.netlify.app/) we show state-level estimates (latest update is August 2020). We also published an article in the Mexican newspaper Nexos explaining the model results [here](https://datos.nexos.com.mx/?p=1469)."
