I am a data analyst with experience in marketing research and ecology. I currently work at [Kantar](https://www.kantar.com/) doing analytics and development with R. Before that, I worked at [CONABIO](https://www.gob.mx/conabio) (Mexicoâ€™s National Commission of Biodiversity) doing statistical analysis related to biodiversity.

I have participated in two [Mexican Electoral Quickcounts](https://portal.ine.mx/conteos-rapidos-procesos-electorales-federal-y-locales-2020-2021/), in 2021 as Technical Committee Member, and in 2018 as Technical Committee Collaborator.

I also enjoy teaching. I teach statistics courses to master students in Data Science and to bachelor/undergraduate students in Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences at [ITAM](https://cienciadedatos.itam.mx/es/71/contenido/plan-de-estudios-de-la-licenciatura-en-ciencia-de-datos-del-itam). 


Lastly, I :heart: R, I am co-organizer of [R-Ladies CDMX](http://meetup.com/rladiescdmx/). I volunteer with the Mexican *Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers* [CDSB](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/) teaching R. And I deliver custom R training (introduction to R, survey data analysis in R, data science with R,...).
