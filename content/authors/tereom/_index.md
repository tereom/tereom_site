I am a data analyst with experience in marketing and ecology. I currently work at [Kantar](https://www.kantar.com/) doing software development with R, before that I worked in CONABIO (Mexico’s National Commission of Biodiversity) doing statistical analysis related to biodiversity. 

I enjoy teaching, I teach statistic courses to master students in Data Science and to bachelors in Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences at [ITAM](https://cienciadedatos.itam.mx/es/71/contenido/plan-de-estudios-de-la-licenciatura-en-ciencia-de-datos-del-itam). I also collaborate with the Mexican *Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers* [CDSB](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/) teaching R workshops. And often deliver custom R training (introduction to R, survey data analysis in R, maps with R,...), I have trained people with diverse backgrounds at [RMB](https://www.redmexicanadebioinformatica.org/navegando-y-explotando-el-poder-del-tidyverse/), [CONABIO](https://www.gob.mx/conabio), [SAI](http://www.sai.com.mx), [OXFAM Mexico](https://www.oxfammexico.org), [GNP](https://www.gnp.com.mx), [SAT](https://www.sat.gob.mx/home) and [COLMEX](https://www.colmex.mx).


Lastly, I :heart: R, I am co-organizer of [R-Ladies CDMX](http://meetup.com/rladiescdmx/) and I often give talks related to R.
